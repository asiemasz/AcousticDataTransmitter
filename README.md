# AcousticDataTransmitter
This project is a part of my BSc thesis. Program will controll STM32F4 microcontroller in order to send and receive data throught acoustic waves. 
All peripherals handling is written on registers without using ready libraries like HAL or PLL in order to deeply learn embedded programming.
