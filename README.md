# AcousticDataTransmitter
The project is a part of my BSc thesis. Program will controll STM32F4 microcontroller (STM32F01RE Nucleo board) in order to send and receive data throught acoustic waves. 
All peripherals handling is written on registers without using ready libraries like HAL or PLL in order to deeply understand hardware programming. 

CMSIS DSP library is used for data processing and filtering.
